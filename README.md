# Neural Swarm Model Zoo

The Neural Swarm Model Zoo is a collection of Machine Learning models written in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai).

Accompanying each model are [Model Cards](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf) in the `cards` folder. Model Cards provide additional details such as:

- Carbon emissions
- Intended use
- Loss
- Metric
- Parameters

Datasets are from [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets).
